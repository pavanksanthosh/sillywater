# Java Automation Framework with TestNG

Welcome to the Java Automation Framework based on TestNG! This framework is designed to provide robust automation capabilities for Java applications, with a focus on efficient testing, comprehensive reporting, and streamlined debugging.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with the Java Automation Framework, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- **Gradle 8:** Make sure you have Gradle version 8 or higher installed on your system. You can download and install Gradle from the [official website](https://gradle.org/install/).
- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Install JDK version 8 or higher on your machine. You can download the JDK from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) or use OpenJDK.

## Features

- **TestNG Integration:** Utilize the power and flexibility of TestNG to structure and execute your tests efficiently.
- **Excellent Reporting:** Generate detailed reports in HTML, XML, JSON, and text formats to gain insights into test results.
- **Logging Capabilities:** Each test generates a separate log file, enhancing readability and simplifying debugging.
- **Customizable:** Tailor the framework to suit your specific testing requirements by leveraging TestNG's features.
- **Ease of Use:** Enjoy a user-friendly interface and straightforward setup process.

## Getting Started

To begin using the framework, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone git@github.com:pavanksanthosh/sillywater.git

2. **Setup Dependencies:** Ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed. Gradle will manage the dependencies specified in the `build.gradle` file.

3. **Configuration:** Customize the framework according to your project requirements by modifying configuration files located in the `config` directory.

4. **Write Tests:** Create your test cases using TestNG annotations and place them in the `tests` directory.

5. **Execute Tests:** Run your tests using Gradle commands. For example, to run all tests, use:
gradle test

6. **View Reports:** After test execution, navigate to the `reports` directory to access detailed reports in various formats.
